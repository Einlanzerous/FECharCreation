Character Creation Tool for Fragged Empire<br>

Site consists of a "quiz" to help users figure out what they want to play in Fragged Empire. Also has a manual character sheet. Work in progress.<br>

--REMOVED UPDATE HISTORY (Just look at history in GitHub)<br>

Site consists of five pages- <br>
index: The landing page, just directs users to the other four. <br>
info: Some backstory for the different races. <br>
quiz: Where users can take a quiz that will suggest a race for them.  <br>
create: Manual character creation sheet. <br>
team: Information about the team that worked on this. <br>

FUTURE WORK: <br>
Implement weapons, perks, etc into manual create <br>
Enable printing from create to actual character sheet  <br>
Better writing for quiz  <br>
More complicated quiz- currently a thrown together AngularJS stand-in <br>
