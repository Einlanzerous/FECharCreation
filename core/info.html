                    They hate the Kaltoran people, finding them reckless and unconcerned with keeping contracts.

                    The Legion are unique, in that they were the oly Archon race that didn't fall during the great war.
                    They are a heavily militarized society, somewhat akin to the Spartans of old. This strength and
                    structured government are key reasons for their persistance in the galactic stage. They were
                    designed to fight the Nephilim and as such carry something of a grudge against them- as well as the
                    recently restored Remnant (they betrayed the Archons in the great X'ion war).

                <h5>Nomad</h5>
                <p>
                    These were originally literally nomads that become arctic hunters and gatherers during the early
                    settlement years. They are also similar to rangers from other more traditional games. They now
                    explore the Haven system looking for better lives.
                </p>
                <h5>Specialist</h5>
                <p>
                    You could think of these are thieves, or wizards- but they are highly specialized persons, as their
                    name suggests. They are users of heavy weapons and coordinated strikes, which make them a deadly
                    adversary. They are very intelligent and look for the best ways to exploit a weakness in their foe.
                </p>
                <h5>Mercenary</h5>
                <p>
                    This would be a traditional warrior from other games- this role is a soldier that could have other
                    functions like a medic or leader. They are more likely to use rifles and lead their group to victory
                    through teamwork.

                    Palantor
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The actual last remains of humanity- these are digital minds that were forced into murderous
                    machines by the Archon�s. It is worth noting that the Archon�s thought they were using old human
                    software, but the damage has been done regardless. Because of this, the Palantor are incredibly old,
                    but are psychologically unstable. The Palantor exist in what is effectively an internet, and so they
                    are immortals that can load themselves into robot bodies. Some of the bodies can even be a
                    collection of networked drones, providing the ability to be both C-3PO and R2-D2 at the same time.
                    There are downsides to their physical existence, and going from a digital universe worth of �scaling�
                    to a single robotic body means they have some eccentric peculiarities. They are struggling as a
                    species against the Mechonids, but refuse to ask for help- so you know they are human. It is
                    important to note that they view themselves a creation of the Archons/humans the same as the other
                    races do- though they are purely digital.

                <p>Those giant robot death machines, known as the Mechonids? You stole their body, or someone did,
                    but it�s yours now. You are likely wielding built in weapons, ranging from something like an
                    auto-cannon, to having a radioactive core you can detonate to end a fight and this body.  </p>
                <h5>Ancient Body</h5>
                <p> As the name suggests- these are old robot bodies, actually built by honest to gods humanity for
                    maintaining the Palantor network itself. They are however incredibly advanced, since humans reached
                    the �pinnacle� of technological progress, where the Archons went for genetic/biological technology.
                    These are generally humanoid bodies with built in weapons and tools. Think of a blacksmith or
                    something for this class. </p>
                <h5>Networked Body-</h5>
                <p>Are you having a hard time choosing your body? Why not pick a variety pack and use them all at once?
                    This offers a wide range of options and allows you to be something akin to a cat with multiple lives
                    in a fight. You are literally several bots at once, and can be specialized, maybe one drone is a
                    flight model, one is wheeled, and one has tank treads, you have a lot of choices.</p>

                <p>
                    The Ursai are still blacklisted by some in the Haven system because
                    during the great X�ion War, they betrayed the Archon�s and sided with the invading Nephilim,
                    but were ultimately wiped out for it. However, something akin to space Jesus, but known as the
                    All-Being appeared on their world some thirty years after the Ursai were wiped out. The All-Being
                    returned them to life and they became the spiritual Remnant that exist today. The All-Being
                    has left, but the impression left by it has shaped this entire race- understandably. This
                    race is equipped with psionics, and have some cool energy blades they can use because of it.
                    They are a spiritual race that is looking to discover why they were returned, where other
                    races are still angry with them for a decision they have no memory making. They are a very
                    strict and organized race, who value discipline.

                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <h5>Psionic Monk</h5>
                <p> As the name suggests, these are
                    monks that use their psionic abilities as their defensive weaponry.
                    They are physically well trained, and very acrobatic.
                    They search for the truth in all things.  </p>
                <h5>Priest</h5>
                <p> While one might think about clerics from more traditional games- this is much more like a bard or paladin. They are rule focused, strong in their faith,
                    and focused on recruiting and leading others. They work to spread
                    the knowledge of the All-Being.</p>
                <h5>Crusader</h5>
                <p>These are almost carbon copies of paladins from traditional games-
                    they operate to eradicate evil from the Haven system, and do so through
                    firm convictions, capable leadership, and physical training. Look at the picture-
                    that�s a space knight in armor.</p>

                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <h5>Dragon Warrior</h5>
                <p>Most similar to monks from other games- they are traditional, and focused on
                    directing their race to the stars instead of the static lifestyle They use
                    physical strength and small arms predominately- though obviously using their
                    own energy blasts is a thing as well. </p>
                <h5>Phoenix Mystic</h5>
                <p>Perhaps this class could be considered something akin to a bard or wanderer.
                    More than other Twi-Far they enjoy life and value freedom. The super space
                    hippie role- they use super charged versions of their bodily energy blasts.
                    Otherwise are a knowledge based class. </p>
                <h5>Salamander Engineer</h5>
                <p>Unafraid of monotonous activities, they value the small details required
                    of an engineer or manual laborer. These are great mechanics
                    or engineers for your spacecraft, and will take ownership of such vessels. </p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    You could almost call them voracious tree monsters- but then some are made from metal. The Zhou are
                    the latest addition to the sector, and as such, they are the least organized. They operate most
                    commonly in either small tribal groups, or as is often the case of the Silver Masks, they operate
                    solo. They are still struggling to move away from their weaponized roots- where they were used to
                    devour worlds, and eventually themselves. They live now in varied climates in the system, and even
                    sometimes on ships, but they are having to learn how to adapt and better limit their consumption.
                    They still take more resources than other species, but they are a powerful race that values and
                    utilizes change well.

                <p>These are somewhat like elves or rangers from more traditional style games. They
                    are more primitive in appearance and weapons, but have great knowledge of their environments and
                    hunting. </p>
                <h5>Silver Mask Scientist</h5>
                <p>These are the metal ones, more machine than monster now. They seek to trade
                    knowledge and skills for resources and work to better their lives and the Zhou through technology
                    and advancement. They are likely to upgrade their body and utilize high tech weaponry. You can think
                    of these as scientists, like the name suggests. </p>
                <h5>Stow-Away</h5>
                <p>So about the voracious monsters- that’d be these fellows. Large hulking body shifters,
                    they were literally stow-away creatures on Twi-Far vessels. They weren’t supposed to be in civilized
                    space, and are very dangerous and hungry. If you want to play something akin to a traditional
                    barbarian, who also happens to be larger than many doorways, and devour everything you find, this is
                    the role for you.</p>
