                <p>
                    The Kaltoran's are a family first species- where even their government is limited in size,
                    and instead communities are largely dictated by major family elders. Part of this connection
                    to family is because the Kaltoran pass down memories through their genes. This confers a lot
                    of advantages, as one would imagine, and is what seems them good at so many tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are downsides to this kind of information transfering though- after the Great X'ion War
                    the Kaltoran's had to suffer through extreme situations in order to survive.

                    You could almost call them voracious tree monsters- but then some are made from metal. The Zhou are
                    the latest addition to the sector, and as such, they are the least organized. They operate most
                    commonly in either small tribal groups, or as is often the case of the Silver Masks, they operate
                    solo. They are still struggling to move away from their weaponized roots- where they were used to
                    devour worlds, and eventually themselves. They live now in varied climates in the system, and even
                    sometimes on ships, but they are having to learn how to adapt and better limit their consumption.
                    They still take more resources than other species, but they are a powerful race that values and
                    utilizes change well.

                <h5>Pathfinder Warrior</h5>
                    <p>These are somewhat like elves or rangers from more traditional style games. They
                    are more primitive in appearance and weapons, but have great knowledge of their environments and
                    hunting. </p>
                <h5>Silver Mask Scientist</h5>
                    <p>These are the metal ones, more machine than monster now. They seek to trade
                    knowledge and skills for resources and work to better their lives and the Zhou through technology
                    and advancement. They are likely to upgrade their body and utilize high tech weaponry. You can think
                    of these as scientists, like the name suggests. </p>
                <h5>Stow-Away</h5>
                    <p>So about the voracious monsters- that’d be these fellows. Large hulking body shifters,
                    they were literally stow-away creatures on Twi-Far vessels. They weren’t supposed to be in civilized
                    space, and are very dangerous and hungry. If you want to play something akin to a traditional
                    barbarian, who also happens to be larger than many doorways, and devour everything you find, this is
                    the role for you.</p>
