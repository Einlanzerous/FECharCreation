                    galaxy currently, but are considered pshycially weaker than others and even looked at as greedy.
                    They hate the Kaltoran people, finding them reckless and unconcerned with keeping contracts.

                <h5>Agent</h5>
                <p>These specialize at espionage and infiltration- they are something akin to a thief from other games.
                    They are best used for hacking or breaking to a location, then stealing or eliminating a target.
                    Just goes to show that not all Corp members are in finances.</p>
                <h5>Business</h5>
                <p>Ever wanted to play a merchant? That's pretty much this role- only it's the charismatic shop-keeper
                    from a local town that has global reach. Educated and a smart leader, this role would make a good
                    party lead or administrator.</p>
                <h5>Professional</h5>
                <p>As the name suggests- this role is a professional who is highly specialized into a particular field.
                    Be it designing or building spacecraft, being a data analyst, or a specific surgeon.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Kaltoran are pretty much the description of a dark past- they were nearly driven to extinction
                    during the Great X'ion war. Due to their ability to receive genetic memories, some of them can
                    occasionally remember- undesired at that- when their ancestors had to eat each other in the dark
                    underground to survive. It's amazing that after so many years living in complete darkness
                    underground, they are such a happy people now that they have returned to the surface and space in
                    general.

                <h5>Founder</h5>
                <p>
                    A literal Jack of all trades- they are more traditional than Pioneers, but spread out through Haven
                    looking to make the lives of their family better. Generally they play the role of a mechanic or
                    explorer.
                </p>
                <h5>Pioneer</h5>
                <p>
                    Generally young adventurers seeking excitement- these are occasionally found getting into trouble
                    with other races by focusing on their own sense of personal justice over that of the public justice
                    for their location. The Corporation especially tends to frown upon these displays against accepted
                    law. Happy bar fighters, weapon smiths, gun for hire, all acceptable roles.
                </p>
                <h5>Dark Tribe</h5>
                <p>
                    Very paranoid and dangerous- the Dark Tribe are blind and often eat the flesh of their own kind.
                    They are few in number, but incredible fighters who have methods for dealing with their blindness.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Legion are unique, in that they were the oly Archon race that didn't fall during the great war.
                    They are a heavily militarized society, somewhat akin to the Spartans of old. This strength and
                    structured government are key reasons for their persistance in the galactic stage. They were
                    designed to fight the Nephilim and as such carry something of a grudge against them- as well as the
                    recently restored Remnant (they betrayed the Archons in the great X'ion war).

                <h5>Nomad</h5>
                <p>
                    These were originally literally nomads that become arctic hunters and gatherers during the early
                    settlement years. They are also similar to rangers from other more traditional games. They now
                    explore the Haven system looking for better lives.
                </p>
                <h5>Specialist</h5>
                <p>
                    You could think of these are thieves, or wizards- but they are highly specialized persons, as their
                    name suggests. They are users of heavy weapons and coordinated strikes, which make them a deadly
                    adversary. They are very intelligent and look for the best ways to exploit a weakness in their foe.
                </p>
                <h5>Mercenary</h5>
                <p>
                    This would be a traditional warrior from other games- this role is a soldier that could have other
                    functions like a medic or leader. They are more likely to use rifles and lead their group to victory
                    through teamwork.

                    Nephilim
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Nephilim are a brutal and strong society that view life as cheap and plentiful. It is shaped by
                    views on genetic superiority that were quite literally breed into them. They were created by the
                    X'ion instead of the Archons, and many still pursue genetic perfection. Their society is one that
                    saw the creation of the Emissaries; literally created to look less monstrous and have knowledge and
                    memories implanted that help interface with the other races. The few laws in place by the society
                    are built around the weak not getting in the way of the strong. Public beating for incompetence in
                    your duties is literally one of the only minor crimes they care about. If you have something a
                    stronger Nephilim wants, you can be beaten publicly for it.

                    Pureblood
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Some of these are hold overs from the Great X'ion War, they are original version of wartime
                    perfection. They are large, powerful, and strong minded monsters. Play this if you like playing
                    something like a Barbarian, or just generally want to be a gigantic monster.

                    Hybrid
                </h5>
                <p>
                    These actually tend to be fairly unique, with a lot of different options. They tend to be very
                    adaptive, and are actually increasing in numbers, where the Purebloods are declining. Having a bio
                    weapon built into your arm isn't unheard of for a Hybrid. These are most like thieves from other
                    games, cunning and flexible. But really, like with people, you have many
                    options.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    The above two still look like monsters, so the Emissaries were created to seem less threatening.
                    They are predominately female, and look a bit like green humans. They are grown at full adulthood,
                    and already have fake memories implanted to build their personality. These are most commonly
                    diplomats, spies, or assassins.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The actual last remains of humanity- these are digital minds that were forced into murderous
                    machines by the Archons. It is worth noting that the Archons thought they were using old human
                    software, but the damage has been done regardless. Because of this, the Palantor are incredibly old,
                    but are psychologically unstable. The Palantor exist in what is effectively an internet, and so they
                    are immortals that can load themselves into robot bodies. Some of the bodies can even be a
                    collection of networked drones, providing the ability to be both C-3PO and R2-D2 at the same time.
                    There are downsides to their physical existence, and going from a digital universe worth of
                    �scaling�
                    to a single robotic body means they have some eccentric peculiarities. They are struggling as a
                    species against the Mechonids, but refuse to ask for help- so you know they are human. It is
                    important to note that they view themselves a creation of the Archons/humans the same as the other
                    races do- though they are purely digital.

                <h5>Reclaimed Mechonid-</h5>
                <p>Those giant robot death machines, known as the Mechonids? You stole their body, or someone did,
                    but it�s yours now. You are likely wielding built in weapons, ranging from something like an
                    auto-cannon, to having a radioactive core you can detonate to end a fight and this body. </p>
                <h5>Ancient Body</h5>
                <p> As the name suggests- these are old robot bodies, actually built by honest to gods humanity for
                    maintaining the Palantor network itself. They are however incredibly advanced, since humans reached
                    the �pinnacle� of technological progress, where the Archons went for genetic/biological technology.
                    These are generally humanoid bodies with built in weapons and tools. Think of a blacksmith or
                    something for this class. </p>
                <h5>Networked Body-</h5>
                <p>Are you having a hard time choosing your body? Why not pick a variety pack and use them all at once?
                    This offers a wide range of options and allows you to be something akin to a cat with multiple lives
                    in a fight. You are literally several bots at once, and can be specialized, maybe one drone is a
                    flight model, one is wheeled, and one has tank treads, you have a lot of choices.</p>

                    Remnant
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Ursai are still blacklisted by some in the Haven system because
                    during the great X�ion War, they betrayed the Archon�s and sided with the invading Nephilim,
                    but were ultimately wiped out for it. However, something akin to space Jesus, but known as the
                    All-Being appeared on their world some thirty years after the Ursai were wiped out. The All-Being
                    returned them to life and they became the spiritual Remnant that exist today. The All-Being
                    has left, but the impression left by it has shaped this entire race- understandably. This
                    race is equipped with psionics, and have some cool energy blades they can use because of it.
                    They are a spiritual race that is looking to discover why they were returned, where other
                    races are still angry with them for a decision they have no memory making. They are a very
                    strict and organized race, who value discipline.

                <p>
                    As the name suggests, these are
                    monks that use their psionic abilities as their defensive weaponry.
                    They are physically well trained, and very acrobatic.
                    They search for the truth in all things.
                </p>
                <h5>Priest</h5>
                <p>
                    While one might think about clerics from more traditional games- this is much more like a bard or
                    paladin. They are rule focused, strong in their faith,
                    and focused on recruiting and leading others. They work to spread
                    the knowledge of the All-Being.
                </p>
                <h5>Crusader</h5>
                <p>
                    These are almost carbon copies of paladins from traditional games-
                    they operate to eradicate evil from the Haven system, and do so through
                    firm convictions, capable leadership, and physical training. Look at the picture-
                    that�s a space knight in armor.

                    Twi-Far
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This race is unique in that each member of it is actually two members merged into a single being.
                    Twilinger merged with Faren to create the Twi-Far race; originally even by mistake. The Twilinger
                    were made by the Archons (the race that followed humanity, basically super humans), and eventually
                    met the Faren. The Faren are more akin to aliens than the other species in Fragged Empire, as they
                    are unknown and not made by the Archons. The Twi-Far are also unique in how they approach life- it’s
                    an adventure to be experienced, and they don’t tend to obsess over accumulating wealth or power.
                    Because of this- beauty is a major aspect of Twi-Far life, with the arts being a big focus point.
                    They came to the Haven System primarily for protection from the Oni fleet- which are basically
                    rampaging Nephilim.

                <h5>Dragon Warrior</h5>
                <p>
                    Most similar to monks from other games- they are traditional, and focused on directing their race to
                    the stars instead of the static lifestyle They use physical strength and small arms predominately-
                    though obviously using their own energy blasts is a thing as well.
                </p>
                <h5>Phoenix Mystic</h5>
                <p>
                    Perhaps this class could be considered something akin to a bard or wanderer.
                    More than other Twi-Far they enjoy life and value freedom. The super space
                    hippie role- they use super charged versions of their bodily energy blasts.
                    Otherwise are a knowledge based class.
                </p>
                <h5>Salamander Engineer</h5>
                <p>
                    Unafraid of monotonous activities, they value the small details required
                    of an engineer or manual laborer. These are great mechanics
                    or engineers for your spacecraft, and will take ownership of such vessels.

                <h3>
                    Zhou
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You could almost call them voracious tree monsters- but then some are made from metal. The Zhou are
                    the latest addition to the sector, and as such, they are the least organized. They operate most
                    commonly in either small tribal groups, or as is often the case of the Silver Masks, they operate
                    solo. They are still struggling to move away from their weaponized roots- where they were used to
                    devour worlds, and eventually themselves. They live now in varied climates in the system, and even
                    sometimes on ships, but they are having to learn how to adapt and better limit their consumption.
                    They still take more resources than other species, but they are a powerful race that values and
                    utilizes change well.

                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <h5>Pathfinder Warrior</h5>
                <p>These are somewhat like elves or rangers from more traditional style games. They
                    are more primitive in appearance and weapons, but have great knowledge of their environments and
                    hunting. </p>
                <h5>Silver Mask Scientist</h5>
                <p>These are the metal ones, more machine than monster now. They seek to trade
                    knowledge and skills for resources and work to better their lives and the Zhou through technology
                    and advancement. They are likely to upgrade their body and utilize high tech weaponry. You can think
                    of these as scientists, like the name suggests. </p>
                <h5>Stow-Away</h5>
                <p>So about the voracious monsters- that’d be these fellows. Large hulking body shifters,
                    they were literally stow-away creatures on Twi-Far vessels. They weren’t supposed to be in civilized
                    space, and are very dangerous and hungry. If you want to play something akin to a traditional
                    barbarian, who also happens to be larger than many doorways, and devour everything you find, this is
                    the role for you.</p>
